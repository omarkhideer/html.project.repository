          Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person. Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition

       <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic."The crowns on the surface of these viruses give the virus family its name - Corona, because it resembles the appearance of the crown.</p>

   <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the world’s scientific community like no other recent crisis, including many researchers using the most modern data science and artificial intelligence approaches. At the University of Chicago, public health experts, computer scientists, economists and policy analysts have launched projects using computational tools to better detect, diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of the deadly virus.</p>
   <p>This summer, three of these projects received seed funding from the<a href="http://c3dti.ai">C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI)</a>", a new partnership of technology companies and universities committed to accelerating the benefits of artificial intelligence for business, government and society. The research attacks the pandemic from several angles: helping policymakers control disease spread by identifying and addressing key social factors, physicians detect the disease at earlier stages, and hospitals decide which patients require admission. A fourth project,<a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/researchers-develop-ai-help-diagnose-understand-covid-19-lung-images">a collaboration led by UChicago Medicine’s Maryellen Giger</a>, was funded by the organization in spring. </p>
     <h4> #what about World Health Organization</h4>
     <p> <big> world health organization said that :- </big></p>
     <p> <big> Fact1: You can recover from illness caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Being infected with the new corona virus does not mean that you will be infected with the virus forever. Most people who get COVID-19 recover completely and get rid of the virus from their bodies. If you do get sick, be sure to treat your symptoms. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention early, but phone the health care facility first. Most patients recover with supportive care.</big></p>
     <p><big> fact2:-The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas where the climate is hot and humid From the evidence available so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. Whatever the climate, take precautions if you live in or intend to travel to an area where COVID-19 infection has been reported. Perhaps the best way to protect yourself from contracting COVID-19 is to wash your hands regularly. By doing this, you can get rid of viruses that may be stuck on your hands and thus avoid possible infection if you touch your eyes, mouth or nose.</big></p>
